Complete the data structure in the notebook to get the tests to pass. Since I am giving you explicit tests, it goes without saying that I should be able to create equivalent tests and they should pass too. If you were asked to create a square function and the test you see is "assert square(2) == 4" I might also test "assert square(3) == 9" privately so cute answers like

def square(num):

   return 4

will not receive a good grade despite having "passed the test".  Complete the jupyter notebook and submit.
